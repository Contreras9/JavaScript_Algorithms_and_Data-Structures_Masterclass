// Write a function whci takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// Can I restate the problem in my own words?
"Implement Addition"
// What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// - integers?
// - floaters?
// What about strings for large numbers?
// - integers, floaters. strings
// What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
// How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
